# Explain project

* This project consist on the Customer Behaviour Dataset with original 11 features and 350 rows. Other tables will compose the dataset such as generations (synthetic ages based on actual year) and income average per cities as well as augmentation for Deep Learning usage and justification. The main goal is to test and evaluate our DL model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall as well as in the train and test splits.
* Further git workflow will be in use to demonstrate our collaboration throughout this project.
